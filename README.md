## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms which in it's most basic form loops through the set as many times as there are elements and swaps the elements accordingly.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort iterates over elements in the list building a "sorted" and "unsorted" area of the list. Each iteration compares the input value to all the values currently in the sorted side and places the first one to match the criteria there.

## Selection sort
This algorithm works by finding the lowest unsorted element and placing it to the "sorted" side of the list each pass growing the sorted side by selecting the next value up from the unsorted side and swapping the end of the unsorted side with the new head of the sorted side.
